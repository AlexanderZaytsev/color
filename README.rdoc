== Description

Colour is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace
manipulation support to applications that require it. It also provides 152
named RGB colours (184 with spelling variations) that are commonly supported in
HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A technique for generating monochromatic
contrasting palettes is also included.

The Colour library performs purely mathematical manipulation of the colours
based on colour theory without reference to colour profiles (such as sRGB or
Adobe RGB). For most purposes, when working with RGB and HSL colour spaces,
this won't matter. Absolute colour spaces (like CIE L*a*b* and XYZ) and cannot
be reliably converted to relative colour spaces (like RGB) without colour
profiles.

Colour version 1.7.1 adds Colour::RGB::RebeccaPurple for the colour #663399 in
honour of Rebecca Meyer, the daughter of Eric Meyer, who passed away on the 7th
of June, 2014. Her favourite colour was purple.

Barring bugs introduced in this release, this is the last version of color that
supports Ruby 1.8, so make sure that your gem specification is set properly (to
<tt>~> 1.6</tt>) if that matters for your application.

== History

Colour is the result of a project merge between color.rb 0.1.0 by
Matt Lyon and color-tools 1.3 by Austin Ziegler. Please see History.txt for
details on the changes this merge brings.

Colour::Palette::MonoContrast was developed based on techniques described by
Andy “Malarkey” Clarke[1], implemented in JavaScript by Steve G. Chipman at
SlayerOffice[2] and by Patrick Fitzgerald of BarelyFitz[3] in PHP.
